# OfflineUUIDFix

This is a simple Forge mod (that you only need to use on a server) to force it
to always use the online player UUID even if `online-mode=true`. 

You would probably want it if you switch the `online-mode` to `false` after started playing, so you won't lose 
anything related to your player.

The fix is slightly based on the [LanServerProperties](https://github.com/rikka0w0/LanServerProperties/tree/1.18) mod from [rikka0w0](https://github.com/rikka0w0)
